## REQUIREMENTS

Generate a N x N grid, where N can be any number, and randomly populate the grid with letters (A-Z).

Using the provided dictionary file find all:

1. Horizontal words from left to right with 2 or more letters
2. Horizontal words from right to left with 2 or more letters
3. Vertical words from top to bottom with 2 or more letters
4. Vertical words from bottom to top with 2 or more letters

Your solution must **include tests** (eg: RSpec), and a simple way to mock a particular grid of letters so we can test it with our own grid.

Please use all best practices that you deem relevant. Comment your code.

Bonus points for:
- speed and efficiency
- finding words on the diagonal
- ability to run from the command line, passing the grid size as an argument
